## Hi üëã I'm Zaki! Welcome to my Github üêô

I am a software engineer with more than 15 years experience building web applications. I'm passionate about frontend technology and the intersection between development and design. I'm also a musician and a photographer.

I build websites, apps and platforms, I run my own business and I lead a small team.

We help customers in the library space organise and search books, articles and publications and our products are used by Stanford University, University of Pennsylvania and British Library among others.

In the past I have built web applications for the Danish Broadcasting Corporation, Gubra and Airtame.

I'm on Stackoverflow:
